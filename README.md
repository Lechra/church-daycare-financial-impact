# Financial Impact Analysis: Church Daycare Program

## Overview
This project applies a consulting-style analytics framework to evaluate the financial sustainability of a mid-sized church considering the introduction of a daycare program. The analysis compares historical income trends with projected revenue scenarios to assess whether a daycare could provide more stable and predictable funding.

## Business Question
Can introducing a daycare program improve long-term financial stability and support community engagement compared to reliance on tithes and offerings alone?

## Approach
- Analyzed historical income and membership data (2022–2025)
- Built a three-year projected revenue model (2026–2028)
- Compared donation-only income versus a diversified model including daycare revenue
- Visualized yearly and monthly income trends to support executive decision-making

## Key Insights
- Income based solely on tithes and offerings showed volatility and limited growth
- Projected daycare revenue introduces consistent monthly cash flow
- Yearly income projections demonstrate improved financial stability with diversified revenue
- Membership growth remains modest but supports broader community engagement

## Recommendation
Pursue a phased daycare launch beginning in 2026 to validate enrollment assumptions and manage operational risk while benefiting from predictable, diversified income.
